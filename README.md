# Hatsune of Ashina

Replaces the Wolf with a Miku-styled model for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
The mesh and textures were created in Blender and hand-tuned to match Sekiro’s lighting and animation style, so she actually fits in the world instead of looking like a meme skin dropped into feudal Japan.

## Outfits Included

### 1. Wandering Cantor (Light Attire)
Pale attire, blue accents. Hair bound in twin-tails,
and she carries a leek revered as sacred by all in Ashina.
Questioning it is not advised.

### 2. Ashen Shrineblade (Black Kimono)
Hair unbound. Black cloth with restrained patterning and waraji sandals.
A crimson blade.

## Features

- Custom 3D model (sculpted, rigged, weighted in Blender)
- Original textures tuned for Sekiro’s materials
- Optional voice line replacements (can be removed)
- Works in cutscenes and gameplay
- Uses Mod Engine 2, no file overwrites
