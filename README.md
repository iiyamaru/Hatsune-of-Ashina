# Hatsune of Ashina

**Hatsune of Ashina** is a character replacement mod for *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*.  
It replaces Wolf with a custom, Miku-inspired model. The model and textures were done in Blender
and adjusted so they sit naturally in Sekiro’s lighting and animation style.

## Outfits Included

### 1. Wandering Cantor (Light Attire)
Pale attire, blue accents. Hair bound in twin-tails,
and she carries a leek revered as sacred by all in Ashina.
Questioning it is not advised.

### 2. Ashen Shrineblade (Black Kimono)
Hair unbound. Black cloth with restrained patterning and waraji sandals.
A crimson blade.

## Features

- Custom 3D model (sculpted, rigged, weighted in Blender)
- Original textures tuned for Sekiro’s materials
- Optional voice line replacements (can be removed)
- Works in cutscenes and gameplay
- Uses Mod Engine 2, no file overwrites
